      Database Architecture
      - Core Entities: Customer (auth, payments, location), Vendor (restaurant details, menu), Food (items, pricing, inventory), Admin (platform management)
      - Relationships: Customer 1:Many Orders, Vendor 1:Many Food, Order Many:Many Food, Order 1:1 Payment, Food 1:1 Inventory

      API Structure
      - Public: /api/public/_
      - Customer (Auth): /api/v1/_
      - Admin: /api/admin/*

      Payment Integration
      - Setup Intent Flow: 1. Customer initiates 2. API requests from Stripe 3. Client secret returned 4. Payment method saved 5. Order created 6. Payment processed

      Core Components
      - Database: PostgreSQL operations
      - Router: API routing
      - Response: JSON standardization
      - JWTService: Token management
      - CloudinaryService: Image handling

        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "...",
          "data": {},
          "status_code": 200
        }
      - Error:
        {
          "success": false,
          "message": "...",
          "data": [],
          "status_code": 400
        }

      Business Logic Flow
      1. Order placement
      2. Inventory check
      3. Payment processing
      4. Status updates
      5. Vendor notification
      6. Fulfillment
      7. Completion

      Future Enhancements
      - WebSocket notifications
      - Performance optimization


      Current Work:
      - HTTP Caching vs. Data Caching: We distinguished between HTTP caching (caching HTTP responses) and data caching (caching data in Redis).
      - RedisService: We discussed your RedisService class and how it encodes/decodes data to JSON for storage in Redis.
      - Cache Key Generation: We analyzed how your CacheMiddleware generates a unique cache key based on the request method, path, and query parameters.
      - Middleware Execution Order: We emphasized the importance of executing authentication middleware before caching middleware for security reasons.
      - Response Class Refactoring: We refactored your Response class to be object-oriented and encapsulate the response body, headers, and status code.
      - Dependency Injection: We analyzed the trade-offs between explicit dependency injection (injecting RedisService into CacheMiddleware in `index.php`) and other approaches.
      - Handle method: We clarified that the `handle` method is not a form of DI itself.
